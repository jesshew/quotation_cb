### Current Challenges

6. **What are the biggest challenges your firm is currently facing?**
   Managing high volumes of customer inquiries, especially when most of them are repeated(asking about order update etc), and maintaining consistent service quality across 500 outlets.

7. **Can you describe your current processes?**
   Currently, customer service is managed through a combination of in-store staff and a basic online support system (live agent), leading to delays and inconsistencies.

### Workflow and System Impact

8. **How will this solution benefit your firm as a whole?**
   It will streamline customer interactions, reduce response times, automate simple commonly asked questions (ie: delivery app order update, navigate them to the right tab to do what they want),free up staff to focus on in-store customer experience. Doing so will help us reduce live agent cost.

### Existing Workflow or System

9. **Can you describe your current workflow or system?**
   We utilize a basic Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for online orders and a separate platform for managing offline operations. Our online orders are processed through our proprietary app and third-party delivery apps, while in-store orders are handled manually by staff. There is minimal integration between these systems, resulting in fragmented data management and limited automation.

### Pain Point Identification

10. **Where is your current system falling short or causing delays?**
    The lack of integration between online and offline systems leads to delays in order processing and difficulty in providing real-time updates to customers. Additionally, our current support system struggles to handle the high volume of repetitive inquiries, resulting in longer response times and decreased customer satisfaction.

11. **Are there any parts of the process that are particularly time-consuming/prone to error?**
    Managing repetitive customer inquiries such as order status updates and menu information manually is highly time-consuming and prone to human error. This not only delays response times but also increases the likelihood of incorrect information being provided to customers.
