#Requirement 1

Company Background and Industry
Can you provide some background about your company? Zus Coffee is a Malaysian-based coffee chain with 500 outlets nationwide, offering a variety of food, beverages, and merchandise. We handle both offline and online orders through our app / third party delivery apps.
Which industry do you operate in, and what is your companyâ€™s niche or specialization? We operate in the Food and Beverage industry, specializing in premium coffee and a diverse menu that caters to local Malaysian tastes.
Who are your primary customers? Our primary customers are working professionals, students, and coffee enthusiasts across Malaysia.
What are the main objectives you want to achieve? To enhance customer service efficiency, automate common questions / customer service tasks, and implement scalable solutions like a chatbot to support our growing operations.
What key features or functionalities do you need? A chatbot that can handle common inquiries, track orders, provide menu recommendations, and resolve customer complaints when possible, or else, redirect to live agent.
Current Challenges
What are the biggest challenges your firm is currently facing? Managing high volumes of customer inquiries, especially when most of them are repeated(asking about order update etc), and maintaining consistent service quality across 500 outlets.
Can you describe your current processes? Currently, customer service is managed through a combination of in-store staff and a basic online support system (live agent), leading to delays and inconsistencies.
Workflow and System Impact
How will this solution benefit your firm as a whole? It will streamline customer interactions, reduce response times, automate simple commonly asked questions (ie: delivery app order update, navigate them to the right tab to do what they want),free up staff to focus on in-store customer experience. Doing so will help us reduce live agent cost.
Existing Workflow or System
Can you describe your current workflow or system? We utilize a basic Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for online orders and a separate platform for managing offline operations. Our online orders are processed through our proprietary app and third-party delivery apps, while in-store orders are handled manually by staff. There is minimal integration between these systems, resulting in fragmented data management and limited automation.
Pain Point Identification
Where is your current system falling short or causing delays? The lack of integration between online and offline systems leads to delays in order processing and difficulty in providing real-time updates to customers. Additionally, our current support system struggles to handle the high volume of repetitive inquiries, resulting in longer response times and decreased customer satisfaction.
Are there any parts of the process that are particularly time-consuming/prone to error? Managing repetitive customer inquiries such as order status updates and menu information manually is highly time-consuming and prone to human error. This not only delays response times but also increases the likelihood of incorrect information being provided to customers.
#Requirement 2 1. Which departments or teams will primarily interact with or benefit from the chatbot implementation?
Our customer service team and IT department will primarily interact with and benefit from the chatbot.

2. What specific key performance indicators (KPIs) will you use to measure the success of the chatbot project?
Reduction in average response time, decrease in live agent workload by 30%, and an increase in customer satisfaction scores by 20%.

3. Can you provide examples of the most common customer inquiries that the chatbot should handle effectively?
Order status updates, commonly asked questions (how to refund, menu information), store locations, operating hours, and basic complaint redirection (guiding customers to the appropriate channels).

4. What platforms or tools need to integrate with the new chatbot solution (e.g., CRM, ERP, etc.)?
Our CRM system, existing ZUS app, third-party delivery app APIs (Grab, ShopeeFood, FoodPanda), and Zendesk ticketing system need to integrate with the chatbot.

5. What data security or compliance requirements must the chatbot solution adhere to?
The chatbot must comply with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) of Malaysia and ensure all customer data is encrypted during transmission and storage.

6. What is your allocated budget range for the chatbot project?
We have allocated between MYR 50,000 to MYR 150,000 for the development and implementation of the chatbot.

7. Are there any preferred vendors or technologies you wish to use or avoid for this project?
We prefer using AI solutions compatible with our existing CRM and Zendesk, and aim to avoid proprietary platforms that do not integrate easily with our systems.

8. How is your customer service team currently structured, and how will their roles change with the implementation of the chatbot?
We have 50 customer service agents handling inquiries; post-chatbot implementation, they will focus more on complex issues and in-store support.

9. What timeline are you envisioning for the chatbot project from initiation to full deployment?
We aim to have the chatbot fully deployed within six months from the project start date.

10. How do you currently handle customer complaints that cannot be resolved by your support system, and how should the chatbot manage such cases?
Currently, unresolved complaints are escalated to senior staff via Zendesk; the chatbot should seamlessly transfer these cases to live agents within Zendesk with all relevant information.
