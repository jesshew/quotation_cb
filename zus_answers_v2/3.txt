7. **List of Multi-Step Intents:** Will the chatbot manage complex interactions that involve multiple steps, such as booking a custom order or providing personalized menu recommendations? If so, could you provide sample scenarios?Yes, the chatbot can manage multi-step interactions like customizing an order by selecting coffee type, size, milk options, and add-ons. Another scenario is providing personalized menu recommendations based on past orders and preferences.


8. **Intermediate Intents (Text to SQL):** Does the chatbot need to perform database queries, such as checking inventory levels or pulling specific customer order histories? If yes, how many such intermediate intents are expected?he chatbot needs to perform database queries to check order statuses and retrieve customer order histories. We expect around 3 intermediate intents, including verifying order details, checking inventory for menu items, and accessing past purchase records.


9. **Conversation Flow:** Could you provide example conversation flows for two end-to-end interactions, such as checking order status and providing menu recommendations?
Checking Order Status:

User: "I'm looking for something sweet."
Chatbot: "Sure, would you like a beverage or a dessert?"
User: "Dessert."
Chatbot: "We have brownies, cheesecake, and cookies. Which one would you like?"

10. **Data Processing:** Do you require preprocessing steps to clean and organize existing customer data before integrating with the chatbot? If so, how many documents or data sources need cleaning?
i think so, they are pretty scattered and different platform uses different format. 

11. **Existing Knowledge Base Inventory:** What existing knowledge resources should the chatbot access, such as FAQs, store locator data, or internal product information? How would you rate the quality and structure of this content?
The chatbot should access our FAQs, store locator data, menu details, and order management information. Currently, the quality is moderate; some data needs updating and better structuring to ensure accurate information retrieval.

12. **Usage Expectations:** What are the expected usage volumes for the chatbot on a daily and weekly basis? Do you anticipate significant growth in chatbot interactions over time? We expect around 2,000 interactions daily, with peak times during morning and evening hours

13. **Concurrent User Load:** How many users do you expect to interact with the chatbot simultaneously? What is the required capacity for handling parallel conversations without performance degradation? We expect up to 500 users interacting simultaneously during peak hours. The system should handle at least 1,000 parallel conversations to ensure smooth performance without delays.

14. **Peak Usage Patterns:** What are your expected peak hours for chatbot usage, and what is the maximum interaction volume you anticipate during these periods? Are there seasonal peaks to consider? Peak hours are typically from 8 AM to 10 AM and 5 PM to 7 PM daily, with up to 1,000 interactions per hour. Additionally, seasonal peaks occur during holidays and festive seasons, potentially increasing interaction volume by 30%.

15. **AI Integration:** Beyond handling text-based inquiries, do you require the chatbot to integrate advanced AI features such as speech recognition or image processing? Can you provide specific use cases for these AI capabilities? Just text based for now.

16. **Platform Needs:** Which platforms should the chatbot support (e.g., web, mobile app, social media channels)? Can you specify the expected usage volume for each platform and indicate which should be prioritized?
The chatbot should support our mobile app, website, whatsapp, if possible, major social media channels like Facebook and Instagram. The mobile app and whatsapp are the highest priority, followed by the website. Social media channels are less prioritised.

20. **Feedback Mechanisms Implementation:** How would you like to collect user feedback and metrics, such as customer satisfaction scores? Should these be collected after every interaction or randomly, and would you require a dashboard to monitor chatbot performance?
We'd like to collect feedback after every interaction with a quick rating and optional comments. Additionally, random feedback prompts can gather more insights. A dashboard to monitor real-time performance metrics and customer satisfaction scores would be essential for continuous improvement.

21. **Web Scraping Requirements:** If the chatbot needs to obtain information from external websites, how many websites and pages would need to be scraped, and how frequently should this data be updated? id ont know, probably our own websites
