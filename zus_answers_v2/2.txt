**1. Which departments or teams will primarily interact with or benefit from the chatbot implementation?**  
Our customer service team and IT department will primarily interact with and benefit from the chatbot.

**2. What specific key performance indicators (KPIs) will you use to measure the success of the chatbot project?**  
Reduction in average response time, decrease in live agent workload by 30%, and an increase in customer satisfaction scores by 20%.

**3. Can you provide examples of the most common customer inquiries that the chatbot should handle effectively?**  
Order status updates, commonly asked questions (how to refund, menu information), store locations, operating hours, and basic complaint redirection (guiding customers to the appropriate channels).

**4. What platforms or tools need to integrate with the new chatbot solution (e.g., CRM, ERP, etc.)?**  
Our CRM system, existing ZUS app, third-party delivery app APIs (Grab, ShopeeFood, FoodPanda), and Zendesk ticketing system need to integrate with the chatbot.

**5. What data security or compliance requirements must the chatbot solution adhere to?**  
The chatbot must comply with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) of Malaysia and ensure all customer data is encrypted during transmission and storage.

**6. What is your allocated budget range for the chatbot project?**  
We have allocated between MYR 50,000 to MYR 150,000 for the development and implementation of the chatbot.

**7. Are there any preferred vendors or technologies you wish to use or avoid for this project?**  
We prefer using AI solutions compatible with our existing CRM and Zendesk, and aim to avoid proprietary platforms that do not integrate easily with our systems.

**8. How is your customer service team currently structured, and how will their roles change with the implementation of the chatbot?**  
We have 50 customer service agents handling inquiries; post-chatbot implementation, they will focus more on complex issues and in-store support.

**9. What timeline are you envisioning for the chatbot project from initiation to full deployment?**  
We aim to have the chatbot fully deployed within six months from the project start date.

**10. How do you currently handle customer complaints that cannot be resolved by your support system, and how should the chatbot manage such cases?**  
Currently, unresolved complaints are escalated to senior staff via Zendesk; the chatbot should seamlessly transfer these cases to live agents within Zendesk with all relevant information.
